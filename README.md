# Decantr Content

Official content for the Decantr design intelligence registry. This repo is the source of truth for all `@official` namespace content served by `api.decantr.ai`.

This content enriches registry-backed blueprint, archetype, pattern, theme, and shell flows. It is not required for brownfield attach or contract-only Decantr adoption: those CLI paths can run from local project analysis and generated contract files without connecting to the official registry. Brownfield project-owned local law created by `decantr codify --from-audit` lives in the app repo under `.decantr/local-patterns.json` and `.decantr/rules.json`; it is intentionally separate from this official registry corpus. Offline blueprint/theme enrichment can point the CLI at a local checkout of this repo with `DECANTR_CONTENT_DIR=/path/to/decantr-content` or use an equivalent local cache/custom content source.

Join the [Decantr Discord](https://discord.gg/WeDpBd4xFU) for quick setup help, showcase feedback, and live content discussion. GitHub issues and PRs remain the canonical path for bugs, feature requests, and proposed registry content changes.

## Structure

```
patterns/       — UI section components (hero, kpi-grid, chat-thread, etc.)
themes/         — Color palettes, modes, treatment metadata, and DNA-inference hints
blueprints/     — Complete app compositions (saas-dashboard, etc.)
archetypes/     — App-level templates (ai-chatbot, saas-dashboard, etc.)
shells/         — Page layout containers (sidebar-main, topbar-main, etc.)
```

## Publishing

Changes are validated in CI on PRs and again after they land on `main`. A push to `main` does not mutate the hosted registry by default.

CI checks every content file with `node validate.js`, runs Decantr Content Health, audits intentional warning suppressions, and certifies the active registry catalog against the Decantr V2 / Essence V4 product boundary. Public contributors do not need registry credentials to validate or propose content changes.

Every active blueprint must include `blueprint_portfolio` metadata. Public registry users only see the simple sets: `All`, `Featured`, `Certified`, and opt-in `Labs`. Maintainer-only maturity labels can fold overlapping legacy slugs out of browse/search while keeping those slugs directly addressable for compatibility.

Registry sync is a separate maintainer-controlled step through the `Publish to Registry` workflow. Manual dispatch defaults to `dry_run: true`; a live sync requires an explicit non-dry-run dispatch with scoped registry credentials. Stale live-content pruning is opt-in through `prune_missing` / `PRUNE_MISSING=true` and should only run after reviewing a dry-run report.

## Local Development

For contributors (no credentials required):

```bash
npm install
npm run schemas:sync                                                             # refresh vendored schemas from a sibling decantr-monorepo checkout
npm run validate                                                                 # validate every JSON file against the schemas
npm run registry:v2-certify                                                      # prove active blueprints compile to Essence v4
npm run content:health                                                           # local content health report, fails only on blocking errors
npx @decantr/cli content check                                                    # same Content Health workflow through the 2.7 CLI namespace
npm run content:health:json && npm run content:health:suppressions                # fail if a warning is new or no longer intentionally suppressed
npm run registry:audit -- --report-json=./registry-drift-report.json             # read-only diff against the live registry
node scripts/audit-content-intelligence.js --report-json=./content-intelligence-report.json
```

External contributors can verify their changes with `npm run validate` and the read-only audit scripts. Registry publishing is handled by Decantr maintainers.

## Auditing Content Health

Use Content Health when you want a repo-local quality report before opening or merging a content PR:

```bash
npm run content:health
npm run content:health:json
npx @decantr/cli content check
```

What it reports:
- invalid or duplicate content records
- stale ids or filename mismatches
- missing hard references that block registry correctness
- missing softer archetype layout or suggested-theme references that maintainers can triage over time
- content guidance coverage for patterns, themes, blueprints, and archetypes

The CI gate uses `--fail-on error`, so existing warning-level reference drift stays visible in the GitHub summary without blocking unrelated content fixes. Use a finding's prompt command, such as `decantr content-health --prompt <finding-id>`, to produce a scoped remediation prompt for an AI coding assistant.

This repo tracks the current Decantr 2.x CLI and telemetry package versions so Content Health, registry certification, and publish telemetry stay aligned with the monorepo reliability layer. When Decantr adds or changes public schemas, run `npm run schemas:sync` from this repo and commit the vendored schema copies with the content change.

Warning-level debt is also tracked in [`content-health-suppressions.json`](./content-health-suppressions.json). New Content Health warning IDs fail CI until they are fixed or deliberately added to that baseline with a rationale. Stale suppressions fail too, so the baseline shrinks as content quality improves.

## Decantr V2 Certification

Decantr V2 uses Essence `4.0.0` as the active app contract. Registry content keeps its own schema versions (`pattern.v2.json`, `archetype.v2.json`, `blueprint.v1.json`, etc.), but every active published item must declare:

```json
"decantr_compat": ">=2.0.0"
```

Run the V2 certification gate before release-sensitive content changes:

```bash
npm run registry:v2-certify
```

The certifier builds Essence V4 candidates from every active blueprint and its composed archetypes, resolves inherited shells to concrete blueprint route shells, validates against [`schemas/essence.v4.json`](./schemas/essence.v4.json), and writes local report artifacts. Files ignored by the publish pipeline are reported as ignored rather than certified; currently all first-party content in this repo is eligible for certification and publish.

## Auditing Live Registry Drift

Use the audit script when you want to compare this repo with the live `@official` namespace before release:

```bash
node scripts/audit-registry-drift.js
node scripts/audit-registry-drift.js --report-json=./registry-drift-report.json --summary-markdown=./registry-drift-summary.md
```

What it reports:
- `missing live` — content present in this repo but missing from the live registry
- `extra live` — content still published live but no longer present in this repo
- `changed` — content whose live JSON or version does not match the repo source of truth
- `failures` — fetch or comparison errors during the audit

The audit is read-only and does not require registry credentials for public `@official` content.

## Auditing Content Intelligence Coverage

Use the intelligence audit when you want a read-only coverage report for quality, confidence, provenance, recommendation, and verification metadata attached to live `@official` content:

```bash
node scripts/audit-content-intelligence.js
node scripts/audit-content-intelligence.js --report-json=./content-intelligence-report.json --summary-markdown=./content-intelligence-summary.md
```

This audit is also read-only and does not require registry credentials for public `@official` content.

## Adding Content

1. Create a new JSON file in the appropriate directory
2. Every item must have an `id` field (used as the slug)
3. Open a PR — CI validates the JSON
4. Merge to `main` — CI validates the repo source of truth without publishing
5. Maintainers publish the update to the live registry through an explicit non-dry-run registry sync

PRs and scheduled checks can also run the drift audit workflow to surface live-vs-repo mismatches without mutating the registry.

## Content Schema

Each content type has specific required fields. All items should include:
- `id` — unique identifier (used as slug in the registry)
- `version` — semver version string
- `name` — human-readable name
- `description` — brief description

Blueprints additionally require `blueprint_portfolio.visibility`, `blueprint_portfolio.maturity`, a non-empty rationale, and an artifact status. Hidden or folded blueprints must declare a valid `recommended_alternative` that points to a published blueprint in this repo.

This repo keeps vendored copies of the canonical registry schemas in [`schemas/`](./schemas):
- `schemas/essence.v4.json`
- `schemas/pattern.v2.json`
- `schemas/theme.v1.json`
- `schemas/blueprint.v1.json`
- `schemas/archetype.v2.json`
- `schemas/shell.v1.json`

`validate.js` enforces both the expected `$schema` URL and the local schema contract for each content type.

Themes include DNA-inference hints (`typography_hints`, `motion_hints`, `radius_hints`) used by the CLI to generate Essence v4 defaults during `decantr init`.

Legacy note:
- recipe metadata has been folded into themes and treatment-related fields
- `recipe` is no longer an active top-level registry content type
